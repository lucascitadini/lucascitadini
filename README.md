I'm currently a software engineer, I've been working in the development field for over 10 years and I've worked with several languages and frameworks. 
I like to solve problems and see how any system I develop affects customers.

I share projects I've done here on my GitHub, whether it's a technical test for a selection process, or even a test of a new language or framework. 
If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to send me a message on Linkedin.
